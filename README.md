# SOLID Principals

## Single Responsibilities Principle

very simple a class should have only one job. :)


## Open-Close Principle

objects or entities should be open for extension but close for modification. this means we should not to change the main class, but we can handle this situation by implementing an interface in client classes.


## Liskov Substitution Principle 

every child class that extend from a class ( inheritance ) should treat exactly as it's parent class such as return type of methods. 

## Interface Segregation Principle

A class should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use, so we should give every class an interface that is usable for it.


## Dependency Inversion Principle

High level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
